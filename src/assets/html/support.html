    <li class="li2"><span class="s1"><strong>Certain jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages. If those laws apply to you, some or all of the above exclusions or limitations may not apply to you, and you might have additional rights.</strong></span></li>

    <li class="li5"><span class="s1"><strong>Arbitration Agreement and Waiver of Certain Rights</strong></span></li>
    <li class="li2"><span class="s4">Arbitration</span><span class="s1">: You and Klout Kast agree to resolve any disputes between you and Klout Kast through binding and final arbitration instead of through court proceedings. You and Klout Kast each hereby waive any right to a jury trial of any controversy, claim, counterclaim, or other dispute arising between you and Klout Kast relating to these Terms or our Site (each a &ldquo;Claim,&rdquo; and collectively, &ldquo;Claims&rdquo;). Any Claim will be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA Rules&rdquo;). The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator&rsquo;s decision will be in writing, will include the arbitrator&rsquo;s reasons for the decision, will be final and binding upon the parties, and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties agree that the arbitration will be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including any pleadings, briefs, or other documents submitted or exchanged, any testimony or other oral submissions, and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration or by applicable disclosure rules and regulations of securities regulatory authorities or other governmental agencies.</span></li>
    <li class="li2"><span class="s4">Costs and Fees</span><span class="s1">: If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Klout Kast will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator&rsquo;s fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive. In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate.</span></li>
    <li class="li2"><span class="s4">No Preclusions</span><span class="s1">: This arbitration agreement does not preclude you or Klout Kast from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies. You and Klout Kast each also have the right to bring any qualifying Claim in small claims court. In addition, you and Klout Kast each retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request will not be deemed to be either incompatible with these Terms or a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in these Terms.</span></li>
    <li class="li2"><span class="s4">No Class Representative or Private Attorney General</span><span class="s1">: You and Klout Kast each agree that with respect to any Claim, neither may: (i) act as a class representative or private attorney general, or (ii) participate as a member of a class of claimants. You agree that no Claim may be arbitrated on a class or representative basis. The arbitrator can decide only individual Claims (whether brought by you or Klout Kast). The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated.</span></li>
    <li class="li2"><span class="s4">Severability/No Waiver/Survival</span><span class="s1">: If any provision of this&nbsp;</span><span class="s2"><strong>Section 15</strong>&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">is found to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be deemed appropriately modified to give effect to the intent of the provision or, if modification is not possible, will be severed and the remainder of this&nbsp;</span><span class="s2"><strong>Section 15</strong>&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">will continue in full force and effect. No waiver of any provision of this&nbsp;</span><span class="s2"><strong>Section 15</strong>&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or requirement. Such a waiver will not waive or affect any other provision of these Terms. This&nbsp;</span><span class="s2"><strong>Section 15</strong>&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">will survive the termination of your relationship with Klout Kast.</span></li>
    <li class="li2"><span class="s4">30-Day Opt-Out Right</span><span class="s1">: You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending, within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement, written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address:&nbsp;</span><span class="s2"><strong>Klout Kompanies, Inc, d/b/a&nbsp;</strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>Klout Kast, c/o Legal Department, PO Box 30460 PMB 49964 New Orleans, LA 70190</strong>.

    <li class="li2"><span class="s4"><strong>LIMITATIONS</strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>: This&nbsp;</strong></span><span class="s2"><strong>Section 15&nbsp;</strong></span><span class="s1"><strong>limits certain rights, including the right to maintain certain court actions, the right to a jury trial, the right to participate in any form of class or representative claim, the right to engage in discovery except as provided in AAA rules, and the right to certain remedies and forms of relief. In addition, other rights that you or Klout Kast would have in court may not be available in arbitration.</strong></span></li>
    <li class="li5"><span class="s1"><strong>Other Provisions</strong></span></li>
    <li class="li2"><span class="s4">Force Majeure</span><span class="s1">: Under no circumstances will any Klout Kast Party be liable for any delay or failure in performance due in whole or in part to any acts of God (such as earthquakes, storms, floods, etc.), unavoidable accidents, laws, rules, regulations or orders of government authorities, acts of war (declared or not), terrorism, hostilities, blockades, civil disturbances, embargoes, strikes, or any other event or cause beyond the reasonable control of any Klout Kast Party.</span></li>
    <li class="li2"><span class="s4">Choice of Law and Jurisdiction</span><span class="s1">: These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, without giving effect to any conflict of laws rules or provisions. You agree that any action of whatever nature arising from or relating to these Terms or our Site will be filed only in the state or federal courts located in Chicago, Illinois. You consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of any such action.</span></li>
    <li class="li2"><span class="s4">Severability</span><span class="s1">: If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be deemed appropriately modified to give effect to the intent of the provision or, if modification is not possible, will be severed from these Terms and will not affect the enforceability of any other provision.</span></li>
    <li class="li2"><span class="s4">No Waiver or Amendment</span><span class="s1">: The failure by Klout Kast to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not prevent Klout Kast from enforcing such right or provision in the future and will not be deemed to modify these Terms.</span></li>
    <li class="li2"><span class="s4">Assignment</span><span class="s1">: Klout Kast may, at any time, assign its rights and obligations under these Terms, including to an affiliated entity or in connection with a sale of assets, merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, other transaction, or by operation of law.</span></li>
    <li class="li2"><span class="s4">Miscellaneous</span><span class="s1">: The term &ldquo;including&rdquo; in these Terms will be interpreted broadly and will mean &ldquo;including, without limitation.&rdquo; Titles are for convenience only and will not be considered when interpreting these Terms.</span></li>

You and Klout Kast each hereby waive any right to a jury trial of any controversy, claim, counterclaim, or other dispute arising between you and Klout Kast relating to these Terms or our Site (each a &ldquo;Claim,&rdquo; and collectively, &ldquo;Claims&rdquo;). Any Claim will be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA Rules&rdquo;). The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator&rsquo;s decision will be in writing, will include the arbitrator&rsquo;s reasons for the decision, will be final and binding upon the parties, and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties agree that the arbitration will be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including any pleadings, briefs or other documents submitted or exchanged, any testimony or other oral submissions, and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration or by applicable disclosure rules and regulations of securities regulatory authorities or other governmental agencies.</span></li>
    <li class="li2"><span class="s4">Costs and Fees</span><span class="s1">: If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Klout Kast will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator&rsquo;s fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive. In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate.</span></li>
    <li class="li2"><span class="s4">No Preclusions</span><span class="s1">: This arbitration agreement does not preclude you or Klout Kast from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies. You and Klout Kast each also have the right to bring any qualifying Claim in small claims court. In addition, you and Klout Kast each retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request will not be deemed to be either incompatible with these Terms or a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in these Terms.</span></li>
    <li class="li2"><span class="s4">No Class Representative or Private Attorney General</span><span class="s1">: Each of you and Klout Kast agree that with respect to any Claim, neither may: (i) act as a class representative or private attorney general; or (ii) participate as a member of a class of claimants. You agree that no Claim may be arbitrated on a class or representative basis. The arbitrator can decide only individual Claims (whether brought by you or Klout Kast). The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated.</span></li>
    <li class="li2"><span class="s4">Severability/No Waiver/Survival</span><span class="s1">: If any provision of this&nbsp;</span><span class="s2"><strong>Section 19</strong>&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">is found to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be deemed appropriately modified to give effect to the intent of the provision or, if modification is not possible, will be severed and the remainder of this&nbsp;</span><span class="s2"><strong>Section 19</strong>&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">will continue in full force and effect.
