    <p class="p8"><strong><br>&nbsp;Advertisers.</strong></p>
    <p class="p8">We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don&apos;t share information that personally identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by itself can be used to contact you or identifies who you are) unless you give us permission.</p>

    <p class="p8">We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="p8">We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Klout Kast Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. If you submit a copy of your government-issued ID for account verification purposes, we delete that copy 30 days after review, unless otherwise stated.</p>
    <p class="p8">When you delete your account, we <span class="s1">delete things&nbsp;</span>you have posted, such as your photos and status updates, and you won&apos;t be able to recover that information later.

    <p class="p8">We access, preserve and share your information with regulators, law enforcement or others:</p>
    <ul class="ul1">
        <li class="li5">In response to a legal request (like a search warrant, court order or subpoena) if we have a good faith belief that the law requires us to do so. This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States when we have a good-faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards.</li>
        <li class="li5">When we have a good-faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud, unauthorized use of the Products, violations of our terms or policies, or other harmful or illegal activity; to protect ourselves (including our rights, property or Products), you or others, including as part of investigations or regulatory inquiries; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm. For example, if relevant, we provide information to and receive information from third-party partners about the reliability of your account to prevent fraud, abuse and other harmful activity on and off our Products.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="p8">Information we receive about you (including financial transaction data related to purchases made with Klout Kast) can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental investigation, or investigations of possible violations of our terms or policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain information from accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent repeat abuse or other term violations.</p>
    <p class="p12"><br></p>
    <p class="p10"><strong>VI. How do we operate and transfer data as part of our global services?<br></strong></p>

These data transfers are necessary to provide the services set forth in the <span class="s1">Klout Kast Terms&nbsp;</span>and to globally operate and provide our Products to you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="p11"><br></p>

    <p class="p10"><strong>VII. How will we notify you of changes to this policy?<br></strong></p>
    <p class="p8">We&apos;ll notify you before we make changes to this policy and give you the opportunity to review the revised policy before you choose to continue using our Products.</p>
